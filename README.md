#Welcome to the AICatalogue - by Harry Yin

This repo hopes to create a list of *usable* and *simple* AI Algorithms for everyone. We have three main categories: **Reinforcement**, **Supervised**, and **LLM**.

##Reinforcement

This category contains general algorithms that fall under the category **Reinforcement**. That means the following algorithms grow based on information and states that are inputted.
