# Welcome to the AICatalogue
**By:** *Harry Yin*

This repository hopes to create a list of *usable* and *simple* AI Algorithms for everyone. We have three main categories: **Reinforcement**, **Supervised**, and **LLM**.

## Reinforcement

This category contains general algorithms that fall under the category **Reinforcement**. That means the following algorithms grow based on information and states that are inputted. 

### Categorical

In the categorical folder there are three files: `Categorical.py`, `CategoricalTestEnv.py`, and `CategoricalUI.py`
The Categorical proper contains the algorithm, the CategoricalTestEnv contains the TestEnv used in the CategoricalUI and the CategoricalUI provides a visual aid and a simple way to interact with the algorithm.

## Supervised

## LLM
